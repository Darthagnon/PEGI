# PEGI
A collection of game censor Age Rating/content icons, mostly from Wikipedia.

## Purpose
Ideally, I want to make a [Playnite launcher](https://playnite.link/) plugin to display age rating "stickers" on games, based off Age Rating metadata, and filter/block launching games based on their age rating.

This would facilitate Playnite's use on a family PC or TV console replacement PC without risking scarring the kids for life or grossing out Mom. 

I also kinda like the look of the game censor icons, stamped on game boxes.

I may try and make some custom icons for the PEGI 2009 set (the best, in my opinion), as its content descriptors I believe should also cover:
- **Magic & Sorcery** (e.g. games with grimdark magical themes, Black Arts, demons, etc. which would be offensive to religious persons)
-  **Blood** (e.g. gore, dismemberment, blood gibs, which add intensity and realism to violence, and can be grossouts)
-  **Crude Humour** (e.g. Conker's Bad Fur Day)
-  **Educational** (boring educational games, that may show questionable content in an educational context)

Playnite features an Age Rating metadata, which could feed in to the plugin, but the plugin must also be able to display multiple SVG/PNG/JPG icons and a text box for ESRB/BBFC content descriptions.
